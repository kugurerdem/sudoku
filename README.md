# Sudoku Game

Welcome to the Sudoku Game repository! This project, led by me (@kugurerdem),
is a collaborative effort between me and my friends. Our aim is to develop a
Sudoku game for educational and recreational purposes while having fun along
the way.

The project serves as a demonstration of how to implement a React-like dynamic
page with custom state handling using plain JavaScript, without relying on
advanced features offered by React. By building this game from scratch, we
showcase our ability to create interactive web applications and manage state in
a more traditional manner.

If you are interested in such stuff and want to be a programming friend, please
do not hesitate to contact me.
